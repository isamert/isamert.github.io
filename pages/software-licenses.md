# What is a software license?
A software license is a legal instrument governing the use or redistribution of software.

# Copyright

---

Copyright is a legal right that grants the creator of an original work exclusive rights to determine whether, and under what conditions, this original work may be used by others.

# Software licenses and copyright

---

Under the copyright law, _all software_ is copyright protected, in both source code and object code forms. Except for _public domain_ software.

# Proprietary software

---

- Closed source.
- EULA (end-user license agreement).
    - Imposes restrictions on the use of the software.
    - Determines if it is a lease or a purchase.
        - Generally _licensed, not sold_.
- Ownership of those copies remains with the software publisher.


# Free and open source software

---

A free software license is a notice that grants the recipient of a piece of software extensive rights to modify and redistribute that software.

# Freedoms

---

- The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).
- The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
- The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2).
- The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

# Copyleft

---

Copyleft is the practice of offering people the right to freely distribute copies and modified versions of a _work_ with the stipulation that the same rights be preserved in derivative works created later

# Copyleft vs Permissive

---

Free and open-source licenses are commonly classified into two categories: Those with the aim to have minimal requirements about how the software can be redistributed (permissive licenses), and the protective share-alike (copyleft licenses).
